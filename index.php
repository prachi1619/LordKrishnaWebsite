                we are in a service to Lord Krishna, for the purpose of reaching out to his devotees.
                Through this website it’s our endeavor to give chance to every human being to understand God’s creation, 
                in other words, to provide insight into the science of GOD. This website welcomes individuals from all 
                the religions/ faith, as God never created any religion in first place. We all are part and parcel of one 
                Supreme authority and it should be our endeavor to understand His creation and serve Him unconditionally. 
                Krishna (Kṛṣṇa) is the source of everything; He is not just a Hindu God. He is the origin of all. Every living
                 being moving and non-moving are all His eternal part and parcel. Krishna is full with all six opulence’s namely
                – wealth, fame, strength, knowledge, beauty, and renunciation, and thus He is the master of the senses.
                He creates these manifested universes in order to reclaim the living beings who are within them suffering 
                threefold misery, maintains them, and in due course annihilates them without being the least affected by 
                such actions.

                <p>Krishna, One of the most widely venerated Hindu gods, worshiped as the eighth incarnation of Vishnu and as the supreme deity. 
                He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness and love.<span id="dots1">...</span>
                <span id="more1">Indian as well as Western scholars have now accepted the period between 3200 and 3100 BC as the period in
                which Lord Krishna lived on earth. Krishna took birth at midnight on the Ashtami or the 8th day of the Krishnapaksha or 
                dark fortnight in the Hindu month of Shravan (August-September). The birthday of Krishna is called Janmashtami, a special
                occasion for Hindus that is celebrated around the world. The birth of Krishna is in itself a 
                transcendental phenomenon that generates awe among the Hindus and overwhelms one and all with its supra mundane happenings.
                Stories about Krishna's exploits abound. Legends have it that on the very sixth day of his birth, 
                Krishna killed lady demon Putna by sucking on her breasts. In his childhood, he also killed many other mighty demons,
                such as Trunavarta, Keshi, Aristhasur, Bakasur, Pralambasur et al. 
                During the same period he also killed Kali Nag (cobra de capello) and made the holy water of river Yamuna poison free.</span></p>

                <p>Lord Krishna was the eighth son born to the princess Devaki and her husband Vasudeva in Mathura city. 
                However Krishna raised by his foster parents Yashoda and Nanda in Gokul a small village in Mathura district.<span id="dots2">...</span>
                <span id="more2">Krishna had eight princely wives, also known as Ashtabharya: Rukmini, Satyabhama, Jambavati, Nagnajiti, Kalindi, Mitravinda,
                Bhadra, Lakshmana) and the other 16,100 or 16,000 (number varies in scriptures), who were rescued from Narakasura. 
                They had been forcibly kept in his palace and after Krishna had killed Narakasura, he rescued these women and freed them.
                Krishna married them all to save them from destruction and infamity. He gave them shelter in his new palace and a respectful place in society. 
                The chief amongst them is Rohini. The Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana, Harivamsa list the children of Krishna from the Ashtabharya with some variation; 
                while Rohini’s sons are interpreted to represent the unnumbered children of his junior wives. Most well-known among his sons are Pradyumna, the eldest son of
                Krishna (and Rukmini) and Samba, the son of Jambavati, whose actions led to the destruction of Krishna’s clan.</span></p>

                <p>Krishna is easily recognized by his representations. Though his skin color may be depicted as black or dark in some representations,
                particularly in murtis, in other images such as modern pictorial <span id="dots3">...</span>
                <span id="more3"> representations, Krishna is usually shown with a blue skin. He is often shown wearing a silk dhoti and a peacock feather crown. 
                Common depictions show him as a little boy or as a young man in a characteristically relaxed pose, playing the flute. 
                In this form, he usually stands with one leg bent in front of the other with a flute raised to his lips.The scene on the 
                battlefield of the epic Mahabharata, notably where he addresses Pandava prince Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, is another 
                common subject for representation. In these depictions, he is shown as a man, often with supreme God characteristics of
                Hindu religious art, such as multiple arms or heads, denoting power, and with attributes of Vishnu,
                such as the chakra or in his two-armed form as a charioteer.Krishna is also depicted and worshipped as a small child (Bala Krishna), 
                crawling on his hands and knees or dancing, often with butter or Laddu in his hand being Laddu Gopal.</span></p>

                    <p>One of the dham of the renowned Chardham Yatra, Jagannath temple is a popular Lord Krishna Temple in India.<span id="dots11">...</span>
                    <span id="more11">The temple is sacred Hindus, and Buddhists. In the main sanctum of the temple, there is a finely wooden carved statue of Jagannath,
                    which is quite unusual as in most temples there are stone murals. 
                    Flanking the statue on both the sides are idols of brother Balarama and sister Subhadra.</span></p>

                    <p>Mayapur, the land of the Golden Avatar, is commonly associated with Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu,<span id="dots12">...</span>
                    <span id="more12">who is believed to be an incarnation of Shri Krishna about 500 years ago. He was the one who started the Krishna Movement.
                    Mayapur came into being in 1970 when Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada laid the foundation of his spiritual base here.
                    With the mental well-being of people in mind, he intended to create a space with an amazing cultural experience and education for the 
                    people to grow Krishna Consciousness.</span></p>
